# InkyPhatAgenda
Displays the next 3 events from a google calendar on an InkyPhat display. If an event is currently taking place the line will be red.

Just a proof of concept for the moment so the code is a mess. Anyone wanting to play with this will need a Google calendar API key (you can follow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python)) and you'll need to run the authenticate the app the first time it runs.

You'll need to find the correct calendar ID and plumb that into the code. Accessing my meeting room calendar won't work unless you're part of my organsiation.
